# CNAD
# Cpanel NODE auto deployment

CNAD is a package to manage auto deployment of nodejs application on cpanel

> Insatllation
```bash
npm i @bitc/cnad
```

# How it works
It watches your `package.json` file, once there is a changes. it install your dependencies and restart the server.

very simple right? ðŸ™‚ðŸ¤© yea.

> Your nodejs on cpanel must be running with persenger.
> You don't need to worry all nodejs on cpanel already running with it.

# Example
```js
//server.js
const cnad = require("@bitc/cnad");

cnad.config("/home/user/nodevenv/site_file_root/node_version");

// Make CNAD listen for other files to restart the server
cnad.watch(["path/to/different/restart/file.txt", "another/path/to/restart/file.txt"]);

cnad.start();
```

> Find your path to npm

Let cnad do the magic. just keep pushing code to your repo and cnad will do the job for you.

But if you push code to repo how will it get to cpanel?

That where you need a workflow. We already have a basic work flow for you. feel free to modify it to your need.

> Now you should be getting how to create your custom workflow

Workflow depends on what you need to build and what type of application
you are running but this package will help you install your dependencies and restart your server for you.
